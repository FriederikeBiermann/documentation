In its rule-based BGC detection mode, antiSMASH first runs a set of BGC-related HMM profiles on the input data and then uses manually curated rules to identify the BGCs.

The currently used rules can be found at [GitHub](https://github.com/antismash/antismash/tree/master/antismash/detection/hmm_detection/cluster_rules), and a summary is available [here](../glossary/#clustertypes)
