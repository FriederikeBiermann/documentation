# New features
##Major
<h4>NRPS/PKS visualisation</h4>
A new modular domain visualistion has been added for NRPS/PKS modules.
Unlike the existing NRPS/PKS domain view, this particular visualisation ignores
domain length information and instead focuses on domain layout
and full module ordering based on any available docking domain analysis and
cross-CDS modules.

<h4>TIGRfam domain visualisation</h4>
TIGRfam domains within CDS features are now shown in a similar fashion to the existing
Pfam and NRPS/PKS domains.

##Minor
<h4>Analysis:</h4>
* Thiocysteine lyase and carnatine-AT domains have been added to NRPS/PKS domain detection
* NRPS/PKS module definitions have been altered to include more domains within modules and not create modules with only one domain
* ClusterCompare MIBiG comparison database has been updated to account for new domains and module definitions
* Pfam database was updated to 34.0, along with matching GO terms
<h4>Visualisation:</h4>
* Pfam and Tigrfam hits in the CDS detail panel are now collapsed by default
* Pfam (along with the new Tigrfam) domain visualisation tab can now be expanded to show all domain names

##Fixes and small changes
<h4>Input handling:</h4>
* splice-variants of genes with the same identifier are now accepted if the locations are unique
<h4>Visualisation:</h4>
* fixed product colouring of HTML buttons

Numerous other small changes and fixes were made internally, for a full list see the git shortlog.
