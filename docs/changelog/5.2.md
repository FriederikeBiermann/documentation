# New features
##Major
<h4>Clusterblast</h4>
The antiSMASH-DB updated to version 3 and changed the URLs for going to regions.
Handling this required a change in data format for the clusterblast database.

##Minor

<h4>Analysis:</h4>

* added detection rules for lanthidine clusters
* improved detection of thioamide-NRP clusters
* updated default PFAM database to 32.0, with matching GO term update
* updated clusterblast database to antiSMASH-DB version 3

<h4>Input handling:</h4>

* added a command line option to preserve long record identifiers (`--allow-long-headers`)

<h4>Visualisation:</h4>

* PKS candidate clusters without colinear gene ordering now record and show the predicted order
* add a command line option setting the HTML view to compact mode by default (`--html-start-compact`)

##Fixes and small changes

<h4>Analysis:</h4>

* the SMART PKS_PP domain now also detected as ACP
* PKS modules without a condensation domain are now considered complete if they are the first module in the CDS
* fix and issue causing some transAT-PKS clusters to be missed
* detailed analysis of Type II PKS has been limited to only those CDS features fully contained by the protocluster
* fixed clusterfinder adding duplicates of its own results

<h4>Input handling:</h4>

* included record identifier of the first invalid sequence type detected
* fixed an issue when reusing results from thipeptides when extra ORFs were detected

<h4>Output:</h4>

* fixed an issue with locations in genbank qualifiers not properly adjusting for region genbank outputs

Numerous other small changes and fixes were made internally, for a full list see the git shortlog.
