Introduction
------------

The secondary metabolism of bacteria and fungi constitutes a rich source of
bioactive compounds of potential pharmaceutical value, comprising biosynthetic
pathways of many chemicals that have been and are being utilized as e.g.
antibiotics, cholesterol-lowering drugs or antitumor drugs.  Interestingly, the
genes encoding the biosynthetic pathway responsible for the production of such a
secondary metabolite are very often spatially clustered together at a certain
position on the chromosome; such a compendium of genes is referred to as a
'secondary metabolite biosynthesis gene cluster'.  This genetic architecture has
opened up the possibility for straightforward detection of secondary metabolite
biosynthesis pathways by locating their gene clusters. In recent years, the
costs of sequencing bacterial and fungi has dropped dramatically, and many
genome sequences have become available. Based on profile hidden Markov models of
genes that are specific for certain types of gene clusters, antiSMASH is able to
accurately identify the gene clusters encoding secondary metabolites of all
known broad chemical classes.  antiSMASH not only detects the gene clusters, but
also offers detailed sequence analysis.
